# Council of LLMs 

## What is better than AI? That's right. A council of AIs! ðŸ˜‚

Welcome to the **Council of LLMs**, where instead of relying on a single AI to give you potentially biased or hallucinating answers, we throw a bunch of them into a room and let them argue it out!

Ever asked ChatGPT something and thought, "Hmm, is this really the best answer?" Well, what if you could get different AIs to debate it, consolidate their opinions, and have a moderator deliver the final verdict? That's exactly what this project does!

### How It Works
1. **Query Phase**: All agents receive the user's question and generate initial responses
2. **Consolidation Phase**: Each agent reviews the others' answers and decides if they want to update their response
3. **Moderation Phase**: The moderator collects all final responses and provides a balanced verdict
